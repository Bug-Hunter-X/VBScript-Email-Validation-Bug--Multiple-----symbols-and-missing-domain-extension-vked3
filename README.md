This repository contains a VBScript function designed to validate email addresses. However, the function has a bug that incorrectly handles emails with multiple "@" symbols and those missing a dot after the domain part.  The `bug.vbs` file demonstrates the flawed logic, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version. The updated function addresses these issues, ensuring more accurate email validation.
